Lomb-Scargle
=============================================
The Lomb–Scargle (LS) searches for periodic components within a time series but only evaluates  data at the sampled intervals and thus can be applied to unevenly spaced data sets.

This code adopts the correction algorithm of Schulz and Mudelsee (2002) to evaluate and correct the spectral bias caused by the irregular data spacing.

The code is written entirely in C.
